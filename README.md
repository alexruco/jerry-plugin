# Jerry Lead Capturing Plugin

Jerry is a simple yet powerful WordPress plugin designed to display a lead-capturing modal on your website, perfect for gathering newsletter subscribers or any other lead generation purpose.

The plugin is named in honor of Jerry Herman, the acclaimed writer and composer known for his iconic work, including the song "Hello, Dolly!"â€”a tune familiar to many in the WordPress development community.

## Development

### Enqueueing Assets

The plugin carefully enqueues both admin and front-end assets:

- **Admin Assets**: Loaded only on the plugin's settings pages, ensuring the rest of your admin dashboard remains unaffected.
- **Front-End Assets**: Loaded only where the modal shortcode is used, keeping your site's performance optimized.

### Google Tag Manager Integration

Each time a new subscriber is captured, the plugin triggers a `generate_lead` event in the data layer with the `lead_source` parameter set to `"jerry modal"`. This allows seamless integration with Google Tag Manager or other analytics tools.
